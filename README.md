I am a 3nd year student of **Algorithmic Computer Science at Wroclaw University of Technology**. The projects I create at university can be found [here](https://github.com/karoljanic/projects-studies).

I'm member of science club **KN Breadboard Computing** that is developing an 8bit computer project. More details can be found here: [*KN Breadboard Computing*](https://github.com/KN-Breadboard-Computing).

I'm member of science club **KN Matematyki PrzemysÅ‚owej**. More about it here: [*KNMPPWR*](https://github.com/KNMPPWR).

I am also developing the **MeetKunde** project, a system for solving geometry tasks. You can read about it here: [*MeetKunde*](https://github.com/MeetKunde).
